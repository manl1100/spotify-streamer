# spotify-streamer

Built an android app, optimized for tablet, that displays an artist's top 10 tracks on Spotify. The user interface allows for search capability, displays a list of the top 10 tracks in a scrolling list complete with album art, and provides streaming playback of audio using Android's mediaplayer API.
